+#CryOut
 +
 +CryOut has been made with a motive to act as a connecting link between those who seek help and those who are capable of providing help. There are times when people are hesitant to approach the police in person and also often there are situations when the complaints do not reach the right people. This app has been made with a motive to minimse such incidents and thus make help readily available for all.
 +
 +##Features
 +
 +###•	File A Complaint
 +
 +The users who seek help can access the portal and register their complaints with us. These complaints will then be available to all the NGOs and Policemen registered with us who can view them and provide help as required. The users will be authenticated by their Aadhar numbers in order to validate the truthfulness of the complainants.
 +
 +###•	Discussion Forum
 +
 +This is a forum for people who wish to discuss their problems with others and seek their views. The visitors on the app can comment on the posts offering their viewpoints and advise those in distress.
 +
 +###•	Want to Help
 +
 +This is a login system provided for the NGOs and policemen to see the complaints which they can address. The authenticity of these NGO and plicemen is also verified by their Identity Cards.
 +
 +###•	SOS
 +
 +An SOS button is available on the screen at all times and is supposed to be used during emergencies when the user requires immediate help. On being touched, an email is sent to us. We authenticate the request and send it to the policemen or NGOs (as required) for immediate addressal of the complaint.
